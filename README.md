The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'FINAL_DF.txt'

- 'Code Book.md'

- 'R Code.md'

In the codebook you will find the description of all the variables in the data set. In the R Code you will find the script neccessary to transform the original data (not provided) to the data set found in 'FINAL_DF.txt'.
This ReadMe.md has been created to guide you throughout the analysis.

First of all, open the R Code found here: https://github.com/AndresGaleano/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/R%20Code.md
Now, open the original Data Set and run the script in the R Code. To load the 'FINAL_DF.txt' into the R console, run the last command in the R Code.

The name of the variables is base on the following:

There are two types of signals: Those from the acelerometer and those from the gyroscope.
There are three types of axis (X,Y and Z)
There are two types of accelerations: Body acceleration and gravity acceleration.
There are two types of modifications for the variables: Magnitude measurement and Fast Fourier Transform
There are two types of measurement representation: Mean and Standard Deviation.

The name of all variables are found in the Code Book here: https://github.com/AndresGaleano/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/Code%20Book.md
